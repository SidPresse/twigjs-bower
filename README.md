# twigjs-bower
A bower package for Twig js


Since the main twigjs project no longer supports bower, this has been created to plug that gap.

The files are build from the main project.

To use:
```
bower install twigjs-bower --save
```

All other documentation is as per the [main project](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/wiki).
